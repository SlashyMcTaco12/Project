                <h1>The New Orleans' Mardi Gras Festival</h1>
                <div>
                    <p class="text">
                        The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                        Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
                        before
                        Ash
                        Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
                        parade
                        each
                        day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate
                        parades
                        take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur
                        throughout
                        New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade
                        balls).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                        parade
                        schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
                        the
                        earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are
                        well
                        known for holding large parades and events (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the Krewe
                        of
                        Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
                        African
                        American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws
                        are
                        strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and
                        small
                        inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
                        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                        originate
                        in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal
                        Street,
                        on
                        the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and
                        Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
                        weekends
                        preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the
                        Courts"
                        between Rex and Comus.

                <div>
                    <p class="text">
                        The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                        River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699.
                        <br>
                        Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice.
                        The
                        date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown.

                        A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
                        (including cross-dressing). An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
                        established.
                        <br>
                        Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes
                        prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or
                        enforcement
                        waned.

                <h1>LaToya Cantrell, Mayor of New Orleans</h1>
                <div>
                    <p class="text">
                        LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving
                        as the Mayor
                        of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the
                        office. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council
                        from 2012–2018.
                        <br>
                        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend
                        Xavier University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive
                        training program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
                        <br>
                        Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she
                        joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the
                        association in 2004. After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane
                        Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months
                        afterward.
                        In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by
                        then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
                        Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the
                        association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition
                        to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a
                        six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.

                        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend

                        <br>
                        Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                        fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of
                        the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development
                        Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case management and other social
                        services for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's
                        Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a
                        partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which
                        provided the neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also
                        formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed
                        Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.

                <h3>Political Career - New Orleans City Council</h3>
                <div>
                    <p class="text">
                        In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when
                        former District B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the
                        November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which
                        Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and
                        was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                        introduced a bill banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health
                        effects of secondhand smoke on service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill
                        in 2015.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was
                        objected to by residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans.
                        Instead, the shelter was moved to the downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell
                        introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason Williams to register and inspect
                        rental units in the city.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install
                        crime cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns,
                        and address understaffing at the New Orleans Police Department.
